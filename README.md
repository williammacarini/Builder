# Builder

I would like to share some examples of how to use the Builder pattern in some cases.

## Builder to create Objects

The Builder pattern is widely used in creating more complex objects, aiding in organizing the steps of object creation. Within the solution, in the console project `Builder`, there is an example use case for constructing a `Product` object.

## Builder to create Queries

One approach to using this pattern is in query creation. Within the solution, there is the `BuilderSql` project where we demonstrate a use case.

## Builder to create HTML Structure

A good option is for returning HTML to our frontend, which can be used in some cases. Within the solution, there is an example `BuilderFrontend`.
